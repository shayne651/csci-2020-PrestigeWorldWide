to run this program you want to compile the Main.java file and then run it.
The first screen that pops up will need you to select the data folder that has Test and Train in it with the Ham/Spam folders in each of them
After that it will find the spam files and display which files are Ham or Spam and the probability that they are Spam
It will also display what the precision and accuracy of the spamdetector 

For marking purposes and full commit history there is a second repository that was used in the process of developing the spam detector.
