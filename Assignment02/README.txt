to run this program you will want to go into the Client folder, compile the Main.java file using javac and then run the Main.java with java Main.When you run the program the interface will come up with the options to Download, Upload and DIR. download will download the selected file from the server onto the client, Upload will upload the chosen file from the client and copy it onto the server. DIR will display all of the files in the servers Directory(this does not fully work on ours, it will show only local files as we didnt get it fully working.).
